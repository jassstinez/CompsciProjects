Requirements for Problem 1: 

Write a program that uses four println() statements to display four lines of the lyrics to my favorite song. Save the class as SongLyrics.java

Design:

I will need to create a file/package that can store class SongLyrics. SongLyrics will have four println() statements using correct syntax with four lines from LOVE by Nat King Cole, each using newline. 

Implementation: 

I created a SongLyrics file that contains a main method. Inside main there are four println() statements, each containing quotes in parentheses. These are separated by newline. Once I ran the program, I got the desired output: 

L is for the way you look at me, 
O is for the only one I see.
V is very, very extraordinary.
E is even more than anyone that you adore can...

Requirements for Problem 2: 

Write, compile, and test a class that uses four println() statements to display, in order, your favorite movie quote, the movie it comes from, the character who said it, and the year of the movie. Save the class as MovieQuoteInfo.java

Design:

I will need to create a file/package that can store class MovieQuoteInfo. It will have four println() statements using correct syntax with four quotes from my favorite movie, the character who said it, and the year of the movie.

Implementation: 

I created a MovieQuoteInfo file that contains a main method. Inside main there are four println() statements, each containing quotes in parentheses. These are separated by newline. Once I ran the program, I got the desired output: 

I want to see and understand the world outside. I don't want to die inside these walls without knowing what's out there!
